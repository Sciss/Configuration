    """Entanglement: My first encounter with sound art, at least
      |according to my leaky memory, was with a work by Rolf Julius in the Weserburg museum in
      |Bremen, Riga's twin city, near the place where I grew up. I cannot recall exactly which work
      |it was, but it was a sound installation inside a narrow severed corner, perhaps with small
      |sounds emanating from a pile of objects on the floor. I always enjoyed going to that museum
      |because of its rigorous industrial atmosphere, a very quiet place except for your own
      |footsteps, yet open and airy. Finding these tiny sounds among this quietness—maybe there
      |was the sound of the kinetic machines of a Kienholz environment or from a Rebecca Horn
      |swing—was a unique experience.
      |In hindsight it mixes with the effort of taking the bus from my hometown to travel there (I did
      |not have a driver’s licence yet). It also gets mixed up with things that happen later, for example
      |seeing Terry Fox’s "The Eye is Not the Only Glass that Burns the Mind" in Worpswede, probably
      |merely due to its regional proximity, or maybe because this was in autumn 2011, not so long
      |after Julius died. No matter what the reasons are, the important factor is that these coherences
      |are outside the control of the artist. My hypothesis is that just as the essence of an artwork’s
      |reception lies in the process of its traversal, the same goes for the production of an artwork.
